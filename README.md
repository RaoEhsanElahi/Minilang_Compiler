# Project: MiniLang Compiler

## Overview

Welcome to the MiniLang Compiler project! This repository contains the codebase for a compiler constructed as part of a compiler construction course. The goal of the project is to create a compiler for a C-like programming language, performing various operations such as lexical analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Features

- **Scanner / Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the input source code into a stream of tokens representing the smallest units of meaning in the language.

- **Parser / Semantic Analysis**: Constructs a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokenized input and performs semantic analysis to ensure the validity of the program's semantics.

- **Generate Assembly / Code Generator**: Translates the AST into assembly language or target code, converting high-level language constructs into low-level instructions executable by a computer.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Compilation**: Compile the compiler source code using your preferred compiler or build system.

3. **Execution**: Run the compiled compiler executable, providing input source code files as arguments to generate compiled output.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MiniLang Compiler project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Explore the Codebase**: Familiarize yourself with the project structure and source code files.

3. **Understand the Compiler Phases**: Learn about the different phases of the compiler (scanner, parser, code generator) and their implementations.

4. **Experiment**: Modify the source code, add new features, or optimize existing functionality to deepen your understanding of compiler construction principles.

5. **Contribute**: If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
